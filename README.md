1. You can access elements by id, tag name, class, name, or selector using getElementById(), getElementsByTagName(), getElementsByClassName(), and getElementsByName(), querySelector()
2. You can access and change element text content using the textContent property, access and change CSS properties through DOM using dot notation that references an element's style property followed by the name of CSS property, and you can access an element attribute using a period and the name of attribute after the element reference.
3. You can open new window with using window.open() and you can close a window with using window.close()
